            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Season the chicken/beef with a teaspoon of salt, one seasoning cubes, half a teaspoon each of curry and thyme, half a cup of sliced onions then let it sit for some minutes.</li>
                <li>Peel off the outer back of the ginger/garlic, pound, or grind.</li>
                <li>Parboil rice the normal way, boil about 7 cups of water in a pot, add the four cups of rice and allow boiling for 3 minutes. Then pour out and wash thoroughly with clean water, then set aside in a bowl or plastic sieve. </li>
                <li>Pick out the parboiled tasty meat and deep-fry, set aside.</li>
                <li>Once you are done with frying the chicken, reduce the oil to 250ml (1 cup) just add the remaining one cup of sliced onions, stir for 1-2 minutes, add the ground tomatoes. I like to cook jollof rice with the same oil I used while frying the meat.</li>
                <li>Frying the tomatoes would take about 20 minutes.Fry until when you lift a portion with your frying spoon, you will notice the oil continues to boil in the spoon.You also notice the tomatoes turning dark</li>
                <li>Once the tomato is well fried, add the meat water (chicken/beef stock) to the fried  tomato in the pot, the ground ginger/garlic, half a teaspoon each of curry and thyme, salt to taste, add 4 cups of water. Add another seasoning cube. Stir and taste, it should taste overly spiced. Donâ€™t worry, once the rice is added the taste would balance.</li>
                <li>Add the rice.</li>
                <li>Then cover and allow the rice to cook on low heat for 30-45 minutes. Remember that you can add water occasionally.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Then cover and allow the rice to cook on low heat for 30-45 minutes. Remember that you can add water occasionally.</p>
            <p>Congrats the meal is done </p>
